# Getting started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Getting Started with Create React App

You'll need to set a value for `REACT_APP_MOVIE_API_KEY` in an .env file to have this working

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### start

Which will set the project (don't forget to `npm i`) to work locally

Also you can find it working here [heroku](https://rockstar-ch.herokuapp.com)
